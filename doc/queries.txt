1. Count all votes for projects taking place at schools where the graduation
   rate is less than or equal to 30%:

SQL> select count(*) 
2    from vote v 
3    where v.pid in (select p.pid 
4                    from projects_propose_at p 
5                    where p.ncesID in (select s.ncesID 
6                                       from schools_s_in_s_have s 
7                                       where s.graduationRate <= 0.3));

2. Find the names of all schools where the average MATH SAT score is above 750.
   NOTE: output was modified slightly (not copied verbatim) to aid readability.

SQL> select s.name 
2    from schools_s_in_s_have s 
3    where s.avgMathSATScore >= 750;

NAME                          AVGMATHSATSCORE

Sarah Bergman School              770

3. Find the donation URLs for all projects focused on math, that affect at
   least 30 students and are hosted at schools with an average math SAT score
   less than or equal to 300:

SQL> select p.fundURL 
2    from projects_propose_at p 
3    where p.subject = 'Mathematics' and 
4    p.numStudents >= 30 and p.ncesID in (select s.ncesID 
5                                         from schools_s_in_s_have s 
6					  where s.avgMathSATScore <= 300);
