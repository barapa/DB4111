1. Count all votes for projects taking place at schools where the graduation
   rate is less than or equal to 30%:

select count(*) 
from vote v 
where v.pid in (select p.pid 
                from projects_propose_at p 
                where p.ncesID in (select s.ncesID 
                                   from schools_s_in_s_have s 
                                   where s.graduationRate <= 0.3));

2. Find the names of all schools where the average MATH SAT score is above 750.
   NOTE: output was modified slightly (not copied verbatim) to aid readability.

select s.name, s.avgMathSATScore 
from schools_s_in_s_have s 
where s.avgMathSATScore >= 750;

   less than or equal to 300:

select p.fundURL 
from projects_propose_at p 
where p.subject = 'Mathematics' and 
      p.numStudents >= 30 and p.ncesID in (select s.ncesID 
                                           from schools_s_in_s_have s 
                                           where s.avgMathSATScore <= 300);
